# Unraveling spectral properties of kernel matrices â€“ I

<p class ="h5">Posted on Auguts 02, by Jeremie </p>

Since my early PhD years, I have plotted and studied eigenvalues of kernel matrices. In the simplest setting, take independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data, such as in the cube below in 2 dimensions, take your favorite kernels, such as the Gaussian or Abel kernels, plot eigenvalues in decreasing order, and see what happens. The goal of this sequence of blog posts is to explain what we observe.


This is an example blog post written in Markdown.

Here is an inline math expression: $ E = mc^2 $.

And here is a block math expression:

$$
\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}
$$


```js
console.log(1)
```

```js
console.log(1)

```python
print('Hello')
